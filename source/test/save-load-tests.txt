# List of command lines to be run by regression tests, see https://bitbucket.org/sborho/test-harness

# the vast majority of the commands are tested for results matching the
# most recent commit which was known to change outputs. The output
# bitstream must be bit-exact or the test fails. If no golden outputs
# are available the bitstream is validated (decoded) and then saved as a
# new golden output

# Note: --nr-intra, --nr-inter, and --bitrate (ABR) give different
# outputs for different frame encoder counts. In order for outputs to be
# consistent across many machines, you must force a certain -FN so it is
# not auto-detected.
